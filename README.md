# CAMEL & OWL: Multi-Agent Frameworks

This repository provides a brief introduction to two related multi-agent frameworks: **[CAMEL](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel)** and **[OWL](https://github.com/camel-ai/owl)**.

---

## üê™ CAMEL (Communicative Agents for "Mind" Exploration of Large Scale)

- An open-source **multi-agent framework** developed by [camel-ai](https://github.com/camel-ai).
- Designed for **large-scale agent simulation, task collaboration, and environment interaction**.
- Supports:
  - Role-playing and interactive simulation
  - Tool and memory integration
  - Research on scaling laws of multi-agent systems

üëâ Think of CAMEL as the **foundation** for building flexible and scalable agent-based systems.

---

## ü¶â OWL (Optimized Workforce Learning)

- A **workflow-oriented automation framework** built **on top of CAMEL**.
- Focused on **task decomposition, coordination, and execution** among multiple agents.
- Key features:
  - Modular design: Planner, Coordinator, Worker
  - Integrated with [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for tool usage
  - Benchmarked with **GAIA** tasks, showing strong performance

üëâ Think of OWL as a **practical application layer**, leveraging CAMEL‚Äôs agent framework to deliver autonomous task workflows.

---

## üîó Relationship

- **CAMEL** = the **base multi-agent infrastructure**
- **OWL** = a **task automation system** built on CAMEL

Together, they provide both a **research platform** and a **practical toolkit** for exploring and deploying multi-agent systems.
